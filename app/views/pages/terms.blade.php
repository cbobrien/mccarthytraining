          These terms constitute the sole record of the agreement between you and  Bidvest in relation to the subject matter hereof. Neither you nor Bidvest shall  be bound by any express tacit nor implied representation, warranty, promise or  the like not recorded herein. These terms supersede and replace all prior  commitments, undertakings or representations, whether written or oral, between  you and Bidvest in respect of the subject matter hereof. No addition to,  variation or agreed cancellation of any provision of these terms shall be  binding upon either you or Bidvest unless agreed to by Bidvest. No indulgence  or extension of time which either you or Bidvest may grant to the other will  constitute a waiver of or, whether by estoppel or otherwise, limit any of the  existing or future rights of the grantor in terms hereof, save in the event or  to the extent that the grantor has signed a written document expressly waiving  or limiting such rights.<br>
          8.2<br>
          Bidvest shall be entitled to cede, assign and delegate all or any of its  rights and obligations in terms of these terms of use to any third party.<br>
          8.3<br>
          All provisions of these terms are, notwithstanding the manner in which  they have been grouped together or linked grammatically, severable from each  other. Any provision of these terms which is or becomes unenforceable in any  jurisdiction, whether due to voidness, invalidity, illegality, unlawfulness or  for any reason whatever, shall, in such jurisdiction only and only to the  extent that it is so unenforceable, be treated as pro non scripto and the  remaining provisions of these terms shall remain in full force and effect.<br>
          8.4<br>
          Should Bidvest be prevented from fulfilling any of its obligations to you  as a result of any event of force majeure, then those obligations shall be  deemed to have been suspended to the extent that and for as long as Bidvest is  so prevented from fulfilling them and your corresponding obligations shall be  suspended to the corresponding extent. In the event that force majeure  continues for more than thirty days after it has first occurred then Bidvest  shall be entitled (but not obliged) to terminate all of its rights and  obligations in terms of or arising out of these terms by giving notice to you.  An "event of force majeure" shall mean any event or circumstance whatsoever  which is not within the reasonable control of the affected party including,  without limitation, vis major, casus fortuitus, any act of God, strike, theft,  riots, explosion, insurrection or other similar disorder, war (whether declared  or not) or military operations, the downtime of any telecommunications line  and/or unavailability of any telecommunications facilities, power failure,  international restrictions, any requirement of any international authority, any  requirement of any government or other competent local authority, any court  order, export control or shortage of transport facilities.<br>
          8.5<br>
          These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the  laws of the Republic of South Africa without giving effect to any principles of  conflict of law. You hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court  of South Africa in respect of any disputes arising in connection with these  terms or any matter related to or in connection therewith.
